# Readability Score

This project is a Java program that calculates readability scores for text using various readability indexes. It provides statistics about the text, such as word and sentence counts, and then prompts the user to choose which readability score they want to calculate.

## Features:

* Display statistics about the text.
* Calculate the chosen score(s) and display the result(s).

## The program allows users to:

* Enter the score they want to calculate (ARI, FK, SMOG, CL, or all).

### Tests Available:

* Coleman-Liau Index: A readability formula that estimates the U.S. school grade level needed to understand the text.
* Automated Readability Index (ARI): Another formula that measures the understandability of text and correlates to a U.S. school grade level.
* Flesch-Kincaid Index: A formula that converts the average number of syllables and words per sentence to a U.S. grade level.
* SMOG Index: Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, a readability formula based on sentence length and the number of words with three or more syllables.

## How to Use:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the Java project in your preferred Java IDE.
* Run the Main.java file (with a file containing text as an argument) to start the program.

## Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Readability Calculator:

* Provide the path of the file containing the text you want to analyze.
* The program displays various statistics about the text.
* Choose a test to calculate the corresponding readability score and age group.
